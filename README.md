This package will implement an easy way to bring `edugain` logins to your invenio instance.

Planned features:

- discovery service that looks native to your invenio instance
- parse IdP-configuration from file/url (manually via CLI or on configurable timer)
- parsed IdP-configurations persist in database
- activate/deactivate some IdPs at your choice (e.g. if your security-team would like to allow IdPs only after taking a look at them)
